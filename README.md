##### Plugin description (long)

This plugin is a submodule for feedback in the assign module. It allows teachers to grade a solution of groups. A group consists of an author and multiple co authors. The grading process is optimized to a single grading action. Repetitively grading each group member with the same feedback is reduced to one grading action, which can be transferred to the whole author group or single members of the group.
